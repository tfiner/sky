First two weeks:
Research papers 12 hours x 2 weekends

Week 3
Spent 4 hours trying to get Example 16 to run
Jpeg lib
Crappy c++ code
Failing because of wglCreatePbufferARB returning null and GetLastError is 0x0d, which isn't any of the error codes given by the documentation for that function!
Man, is this irritating.

Going to tentatively port parts of this over to portable GLFW.  Back to OS X and get the heck out of windows!

I think I should be able to render to an FBO instead (see comment on http://stackoverflow.com/q/21821254/196682).

Next step:  
Render to an FBO.

Port Chap 16.  I want those Nishita functions!

Idea:
Maybe an ambient occlusion might help cloud shading.  Inspired by article on bitsquid:

Writing a minimal OpenGL framework that loads shaders, helps with OpenGL interaction (loading buffers, binding things, etc.).  Looked at a few but they all seem to suffer from a variety of immature thinking: putting iostreams directly in the header, using C, very little error checking (if any), "kitchen sink" classes that depend on Qt, Boost or GLM.  Not using RAII!

What I want is:
Overall goals:
1. Class design that follows OpenGL: if an OpenGL function requires an identifying argument, then that identifier belongs in the class in question.  Ex: A Program class should contain the GLuint passed to ::glUseProgram(program).

2. Error checking with helpful messages.  I'm biased towards exceptions and already have a GLException class and some logging code.

3. A Shader class that compiles, and displays errors.

4. The Program class will contain at least a vertex and a fragment shaders.

5. Buffer management classes.  I'd like to simplify and understand all the buffer types.

6. Use type safety, RAII and C++11/14 awesomeness.
